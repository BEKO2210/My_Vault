# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** Claude autonomously maintains, connects, and evolves the knowledge base so the user can focus on thinking and creating -- not filing and organizing.
**Current focus:** v1.1 Proactive Intelligence -- Phase 6 gap closure pending (0/1 plans).

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1 Proactive Intelligence
Phase: 6 - Gap Closure
Current Plan: 0 of 1
Status: Pending — needs `/gsd:plan-phase 6`

Progress: [████████░░] 80% (Phase 5: 4/4, Phase 6: 0/1)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 18
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 1.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Foundation | 4 | 16min | 4min |
| 2 - Scanning Engine | 2 | 8min | 4min |
| 3 - Core Skills & Working Memory | 4 | 15min | 4min |
| 4 - Deep Memory & Semantic Search | 4 | 17min | 4min |
| 5 - Proactive Intelligence | 4 | 14min | 4min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (all marked with outcomes after v1.0).

**Phase 5 decisions:**
- 05-01: Reuse getActiveProjects/parseInsights from memory-utils rather than duplicating logic
- 05-01: READ-ONLY governance for /briefing -- never modifies vault files
- 05-01: Configurable constants at module top with function parameter overrides
- 05-02: Delegate type-to-folder mapping to create-utils.cjs getTemplateInfo (no duplication)
- 05-02: Hand-rolled minimal YAML parser for frontmatter (zero external deps pattern)
- 05-02: Classification relies on Claude reasoning -- no NLP library needed
- 05-03: Three-layer relevance scoring with additive boosting and cap at 1.0
- 05-03: Semantic search is optional -- graceful try/catch degradation
- 05-03: Filename collision resolved by date suffix rather than overwrite or error
- 05-04: Reimplemented frontmatter parsing locally to avoid cross-skill dependency with triage-utils
- 05-04: Three-tier severity categorization (critical/warning/info) aligned with governance zones
- 05-04: Auto-fixes grouped by file path for single read/write per file

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 ESM issue -- RESOLVED (hand-rolled parser)
- Phase 4 auto-memory interaction -- RESOLVED (works in practice)
- Phase 5: `natural` NLP library fitness unvalidated (fallback: use Claude reasoning)
