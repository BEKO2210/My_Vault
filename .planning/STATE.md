# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** Claude autonomously maintains, connects, and evolves the knowledge base so the user can focus on thinking and creating -- not filing and organizing.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 in progress: Core Skills & Working Memory (3 of 4 plans done)

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 5 (Core Skills & Working Memory)
Plan: 3 of 4 in current phase
Status: Executing Phase 03
Last activity: 2026-03-07 -- Completed 03-01-PLAN.md (/create and /daily skills: template-based note creation with rollover)

Progress: [######....] 60%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 9
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 0.58 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Foundation | 4 | 16min | 4min |
| 2 - Scanning Engine | 2 | 8min | 4min |
| 3 - Core Skills & Working Memory | 3 | 11min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-01 (6min), 02-02 (2min), 03-03 (2min), 03-02 (4min), 03-01 (5min)
- Trend: Steady

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase structure derived from 37 requirements across 6 categories
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 (Deep Memory & Semantic Search) kept as separate phase despite only 3 requirements -- represents the critical boundary between explicit-data skills and semantic intelligence
- [Roadmap]: Research suggests Phase 2 and Phase 4 may need deeper research during planning (ESM module issues, NLP library validation)
- [01-01]: Translated Dataview AS aliases (Geaendert -> Modified) while preserving all FROM/WHERE/SORT clauses
- [01-01]: Updated CONTRIBUTING.md repo URL from old project name to current Firstbrain
- [01-01]: Wiki-links in MOC files updated as part of Task 1 alongside system docs
- [01-01]: Applied voice/tone per user decision: direct "you" for guides, impersonal for references
- [01-02]: CLAUDE.md at 134 lines -- compact but complete, all 6 sections included
- [01-02]: Governance summary in CLAUDE.md uses table format for quick scanning
- [01-02]: settings.json emptied since CLAUDE.md now serves that purpose
- [01-03]: Translated Dataview AS aliases in MOCs (Projekte->Projects) while preserving all FROM/WHERE/SORT clauses
- [01-03]: Monthly Review: preserved "Zettelkasten" as domain-specific term in "Zettelkasten insights"
- [01-04]: Verification-only plan -- no files modified, purely automated checks + human Obsidian testing
- [02-01]: Zero external dependencies -- all scanner functionality from Node.js built-ins (fs, path, crypto)
- [02-01]: Hand-rolled YAML parser covers vault flat key-value + array format without gray-matter
- [02-01]: Obsidian escaped pipe (\|) treated as alias delimiter in wiki-links
- [02-01]: Templates scanned but flagged with isTemplate: true for downstream filtering
- [02-01]: Inline #tags extracted separately from frontmatter tags, merged into allTags array
- [02-02]: Indexer operates purely in-memory on vaultIndex data -- no file I/O in buildLinkMap or buildTagIndex
- [02-02]: Case-insensitive link resolution matches Obsidian behavior via name.toLowerCase() lookup map
- [02-02]: Tag index sorted per-tag for deterministic output across runs
- [02-02]: Index files gitignored as derived data -- regenerable by running /scan
- [03-03]: MEMORY.md at vault root (32 lines) with 50-line cap enforced by rewrite-not-append pattern
- [03-03]: Memory writes triggered by significant actions only (project changes, confirmed preferences), not routine operations
- [03-03]: Layers 3-4 documented as Phase 4 stubs with explicit extension point file paths (insights.md, project-{name}.md)
- [03-02]: MOC/system file exclusion uses path prefix (06 - Atlas/) plus named file checks for Home, START HERE, etc.
- [03-02]: Link adjacency deduplicates evidence per shared target to avoid inflated scores
- [03-02]: classifyFix requires single suggestion AND distance <= 1 for auto-fix (conservative to avoid false corrections)
- [03-02]: suggestFixes returns structured objects {name, distance} for downstream classifyFix consumption

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: ESM-only imports for unified/remark-parse -- RESOLVED: hand-rolled regex parser used instead, zero dependencies
- Phase 4: Claude Code auto-memory interaction with custom layered memory needs empirical testing
- Phase 5: `natural` NLP library TF-IDF fitness for vault content is unvalidated (fallback: use Claude reasoning)
